# TrackLiquid Bot Privacy Policy

_Last updated: May 2025_

TrackLiquid (“we”, “us”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what we collect, why, and your rights.

---

## 1. What We Collect

**User-Provided**  
- Guild ID (Discord server).  
- Wallet addresses you add.  
- Optional aliases.  
- Notification channel setting.

**Automatically Collected**  
- Command usage logs (for debugging and metrics), including on-demand PnL lookups via `/unrealized`.  
- Public on-chain data fetched from the Hyperliquid API.

---

## 2. How We Use It

- To post real-time alerts in your server.  
- To process on-demand unrealized PnL lookups (`/unrealized`).  
- To store your settings (wallets, aliases, notification channel).  
- To improve the bot via anonymized usage metrics.

---

## 3. Data Sharing

- We never sell or share your data with third parties.  
- We only send public, on-chain data to Hyperliquid’s API for position and price queries.

---

## 4. Retention

- Wallets, aliases, and channel settings are kept until you remove them or uninstall the bot.  
- Logs are temporary and used only for debugging and performance tuning; they are rotated regularly.

---

## 5. Security

- We **don't** collect private keys or other sensitive personal data.  
- All external calls (to Hyperliquid or Discord) use encrypted HTTPS connections.

---

## 6. Your Rights

- Remove any wallet or alias at any time with `/managewallet`.  
- Uninstall the bot from your server to delete all your data.

---

## 7. Changes

We may update this policy as needed; continued use of the bot implies acceptance of any changes.
